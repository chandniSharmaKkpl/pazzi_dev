# Comprehensive Police Patrol & Navigation App UI Design Prompt

## Project Overview
Design a driver-focused mobile application that displays police patrols on a fullscreen map while providing intuitive navigation capabilities. Prioritize large touch targets, minimal distractions, and glanceable information for safe use while driving.

## Style Direction
Clean, minimalist interface with bold colors for alerts. High contrast elements, large touch targets, and glanceable information optimize the app for driving safety while maintaining visual appeal.
